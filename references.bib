	abstract = {During a period in the 1980s when both European mink Mustela lutreola and American mink M. vison were present in Estonia, their food was signi®cantly different. European mink ate a greater proportion of ®sh and crustaceans, whereas American mink took relatively more mammals and frogs. This was probably related to a difference in habitat selection. After the disappearance of the European mink, the diet of the American mink in our main study area was similar to that of the European in the same area previously. Two alternative hypotheses are presented for the mechanisms which led to the replacement of European mink by the American species: (i) the two species have a different niche, and the American mink could replace the European mink after the latter had disappeared for unrelated reasons, or (ii) the American mink aggressively ousted the European mink, a process starting in the American mink's preferred habitat (slow ¯owing rivers). At present there are insuf®cient data to reject either of these scenarios.},

European mink feed mainly on crayﬁsh, frogs and ﬁsh whereas American mink prefer small mammals, ﬁsh and frogs. The diet of both species varied between seasons and during the period of alien mink invasion. Concurrent with the progress of American mink invasion, the European mink food niche has narrowed to feeding mainly on frogs, with the proportion of aquatic prey (ﬁsh and crayﬁsh) in their diet drastically reduced. In contrast, the American mink food niche became wider during invasion. The breadth was stable but included a varied proportion of different prey categories: namely an increased proportion of aquatic prey and a decreased proportion of water vole and waterfowl.},

The eﬀects of the invasive American mink (Neovison vison) on the critically endangered European mink (Mustela lutreola) was assessed by analyses of diet and niche overlap during the invasion process. To do this, the isotopic composition (δ13C and δ15N) of both species of mink and their four main types of prey was analysed. Signiﬁcant trophic overlap between the native European mink and invasive American mink was found when they coexisted in sympatry. Furthermore, both mink species were characterised by signiﬁcant individual variation in diet and no obvious change in diet of the native species in response to the arrival of the introduced species was observed. High niche overlap registered between both species in sympatry with no displacement in diet of the native mink in response to the arrival of the invasive mink is expected to have important consequences for the viability and conservation of the native mink populations, as it suggests high competitive pressure.},

	abstract = {Changes in spatial structure of the native riparian mustelid guild including the European mink Mustela lutreola, otter Lutra lutra, polecat M. putorius and stoat M. erminea in connection with the expansion of the American mink M. vison were analysed on the basis of a radiotracking and snowtracking study in the upper reaches of the Lovat river, NE Belarus. Four main questions were investigated: (1) how does habitat selection differ between the native mustelids in the absence of American mink? (2) does habitat use change following the arrival of American mink and, if so, how? (3) does habitat selection differ between the two mink species? (4) how does European mink density before American mink arrival compare with American mink densities after the disappearance of European mink? Before American mink naturalization, European mink density was highest at small rivers and brooks, otter density was highest at larger rivers, polecats were found to inhabit all types of river banks and shores at a similar density. No changes in otter habitat use were found after the American mink expansion. Gradually, during four years of the American mink expansion, European mink became rare at small rivers. However, at brooks used less frequently by American mink there was little change in European mink density. Radiotracking data showed that American mink drive European mink away from rivers. European mink are still found at brooks, however, such small streams are used more frequently by European mink males than by females, because there is not enough food to rear a litter. Following the American mink expansion, the polecat population along the banks and shores was reduced by approximately half. In riparian habitats American mink seems to be a more competitive species than the polecat and as a result, polecat populations tend to decline there. Furthermore, as with European mink, polecat females are at an even greater competitive disadvantage due to their smaller body size.},

	abstract = {The European mink is an endangered species in need of urgent conservation efforts, but whose decline and habitat requirements are only poorly known. In this study we developed a model for mink distribution in Biscay to catalogue variables influencing its presence/absence. Sites were described in terms of vegetation parameters, water quality, riverbank alteration, anthropogenic structures and American mink presence. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify ruling variables and synergies. The model extracted two variables of high significance: water quality and riverbank alteration. European mink was absent from polluted waters and canalised streams. The absence is explained by a decrease in prey availability. In the case of water pollution, bioaccumulation is considered to have a deleterious effect on the presence of the species. In the case of canalisation, the lack of adequate shelter areas and especially the depletion of food resources are also likely to play an important role explaining the absence of the species. Finally, the possible barrier effect of canalisation for European mink and its consequences are also discussed. For the remaining variables, only those describing habitat use by European mink within its home range seemed to have a little influence on the presence of the species. The presence of American mink was a poor predictor of the absence of its European counterpart. Based on the results, we suggest that improved riverbank management policies are needed to ensure the future of European mink in the area. Species introduction and reintroduction programs should consider our habitat model when searching for suitable areas for the species. Further research is also needed on the effect of diverse types of water pollution on European mink.},

Over a sample size of 22 radio-tracked mink (10 adult females, 7 adult males, 2 young females, and 3 young males) between March 2007 and February 2009, we found that European mink mainly rested within brambles and reeds (39.7\% for each type, n=156), regardless of seasons and age-sex classes. On average, the resting site re-use rate was 1.3 (range=1–4.3). Nine out of 10 breeding dens were located in lagoons or tributaries. The only one located along a main river course lost the litter due to ﬂooding. Eight out of 10 breeding dens were in bramble patches. Thick and helophytic vegetation should be prioritised in management plans aimed at improving the conservation status of this species. Promoting this vegetation would favour adequate resting and breeding sites for European mink. A focus on improving vegetation around lagoons or tributaries can help to minimise ﬂooding during the breeding period.},

The European mink is rapidly disappearing whereas the polecat maintains good populations. Seasonal habitat use of both species was compared in the Landes de Gascogne region to identify if some vulnerability factors of the European mink were associated with habitats occupied by this mustelid. Potential habitats were mapped using a satellite picture and 12 main types of habitats were defined. Animal locations were recorded by radiotracking 9 European mink and 14 polecats from March 1996 to August 1999. Resting animals were located by triangulation, and, when possible, resting places were described. Animals in activity were tracked by continuous monitoring. Data collected revealed a strong preference of European mink for flooded habitats, particularly open marshes, flooded woodlands and moorlands. They seldom left the corridor of the riparian forest and their resting places were mainly in flooded environments, above ground (under herbs or bushes) or in cavities between tree roots. European polecats were less tightly linked to wetlands. Most of their locations were in the pine forests outside the valleys and their resting places were mainly in burrows. The strong specialisation of European mink in aquatic habitats is probably one of the main reasons for its decline because wetlands suffer drastic damages throughout all of its range. Maintaining adequate water levels is crucial for satisfying habitat requirements of mink.},

Landscape features influencing selection of habitat and resting sites of male European mink were studied using radio-tracking. None of the habitat descriptors accounted for the habitat selection of European mink during their activity periods. On the other hand, resting site selection was correlated with the presence of bramble patches. Intensive use of bramble patches is explained as a consequence of the need of mink for protection against predators. Moreover, the high availability of bramble patches provides the mink with easy resting sites.},

We analysed the post-release movements of captive-bred European mink Mustela lutreola reintroduced to Hiiumaa Island, Estonia. We tested the effect of pre-release enclosure type, sex, generations in captivity, pregnancy and age on post-release movements, investigated the settlement process and explored the relationship between post-release movements and survival. We found no effect of enclosures on post-release movements in the first 2 wk following release (except that individuals from large naturalistic enclosures spent less time close to water than did animals from standard zoo enclosures) but some evidence of a slight effect at 1 mo post-release. Males moved further at 3 d (but not 2 wk) postrelease than did females, and juveniles appeared to move further in the first 3 d post-release than did 1 yr olds. We were unable to detect a relationship between post-release movements and survival. The largest known cause of mortality was predation, but it was not clear why mink were vulnerable to predation, and the locational data presented here were unable to shed light on this issue. Individual variation also made it difficult to define patterns. These are common problems in reintroductions, and we suggest that in future releases of captive-bred animals, more detailed post-release behavioural observations and investigation of personality types might be insightful.},

Within the first 2 yr period, 48 (16 m, 32 f) founder animals were reintroduced, out of a total of about 75 animals intended for release in the course of the 3 yr project. Prior to reintroduction, the animals were acclimatized using soft-release pens where they were preconditioned with natural prey . A number of individuals (n = 18) were set free in groups of mating partners (ffm, fm) and in mother-offspring groups. Thirty-three European mink (14 m, 19 f) were fitted with intraperitonial transmitters and radio-tracked and surveyed via live-trapping. Animals were monitored from April 2006 to May 2008 to determine the distribution, size and temporal changes in home range. Released animals showed linear home ranges spreading along rivers and brooks. Home range sizes were 7.2 km (88 ha) for 1 adult male, 0.2–5.9 km (1–505 ha) for adult females, around 1.7–5.6 km (17–132 ha) for juvenile males and 9.2 km (778 ha) for 1 juvenile female, respectively. The released adults showed inter-, but only few intra-, sexual home range overlaps. In contrast, juveniles did not show any home range overlaps. In winter, home range size decreased to a minimum of about 1 km. Further, home range size for females decreased around parturition but increased successively at time of weaning. The activity pattern of released animals was highest at night (especially around dusk and dawn).},

	abstract = {Modern farming practices in the midwestern United States have drastically altered the landscape. Most wetlands have been drained, and small streams are channelized to transport excess water away from tile-drained agricultural fields. Loss of critical wetland habitat has shifted the distribution of muskrats Ondatra zibethicus, an economically important furbearer in the region, to highly altered riparian habitats with unstable flow regimes. However, information regarding home-range size and space use for muskrats occurring in these linear habitats is lacking. We used location data from 26 radio-marked muskrats to estimate home-range size and space use in riparian habitats in an agroecosystem in east-central Illinois, USA. Home ranges were highly linear and confined to stream bank edges. Contrary to our prediction, muskrats did not freely move to upland habitat (e.g. row-crop agriculture) adjacent to stream edges to forage. Linear home ranges were longer for adults than for juveniles. Home-range size also was related positively to number of burrows used by individuals. As expected, muskrats used space non-randomly within linear home ranges with most movements aggregated around established bank burrows. Muskrats in riparian habitat are multiple central-place foragers. Our study provides insight into how muskrats, a semi-aquatic species affected by large-scale landscape change, use space within highly restricted linear habitats.},

	abstract = {Quantifying animals’ home ranges is a key problem in ecology and has important conservation and wildlife management applications. Kernel density estimation (KDE) is a workhorse technique for range delineation problems that is both statistically efﬁcient and nonparametric. KDE assumes that the data are independent and identically distributed (IID). However, animal tracking data, which are routinely used as inputs to KDEs, are inherently autocorrelated and violate this key assumption. As we demonstrate, using realistically autocorrelated data in conventional KDEs results in grossly underestimated home ranges. We further show that the performance of conventional KDEs actually degrades as data quality improves, because autocorrelation strength increases as movement paths become more ﬁnely resolved. To remedy these ﬂaws with the traditional KDE method, we derive an autocorrelated KDE (AKDE) from ﬁrst principles to use autocorrelated data, making it perfectly suited for movement data sets. We illustrate the vastly improved performance of AKDE using analytical arguments, relocation data from Mongolian gazelles, and simulations based upon the gazelle’s observed movement process. By yielding better minimum area estimates for threatened wildlife populations, we believe that future widespread use of AKDE will have signiﬁcant impact on ecology and conservation biology.},

We studied the spatial ecology of giant otter groups during dry and wet seasons in the Vermelho and Miranda rivers in the Brazilian Pantanal. We monitored visually or by radiotelemetry 10 giant otter groups monthly from June 2009 to June 2011.We estimated home-range size for all groups with the following methods: linear river length, considering the extreme locations of each group, and ﬁxed kernel. For the radiotracked groups, we also used the k-LoCoh method. Spatial ﬁdelity and habitat selection of giant otter groups were analyzed seasonally. On the basis of k-LoCoh (98\%) method, home-range sizes during the wet season (3.6–7.9 km2) were 4 to 59 times larger than during the dry season (0.1–2.3 km2). Home-range ﬁdelity between seasons varied among giant otter groups from 0\% to 87\%, and 2 radiotagged groups shifted to ﬂooded areas during the wet seasons. Giant otter groups were selective in relation to the composition of the landscape available during the dry seasons, when the river was used more intensively than other landscape features. However, they seemed to be less selective in positioning activity ranges during the wet season. During this season, giant otters were frequently observed ﬁshing in the areas adjacent to the river, such as ﬂooded forest, grassland, and swamps.},

Home range estimation is a key output from these tracking datasets, but the inherent properties of animal movement can lead traditional statistical methods to under- or overestimate home range areas. The autocorrelated kernel density estimation (AKDE) family of estimators was designed to be statistically efficient while explicitly dealing with the complexities of modern movement data: autocorrelation, small sample sizes and missing or irregularly sampled data. Although each of these estimators has been described in separate technical papers, here we review how these estimators work and provide a user-friendly guide on how they may be combined to reduce multiple biases simultaneously. We describe the magnitude of the improvements offered by these estimators and their impact on home range area estimates, using both empirical case studies and simulations, contrasting their computational costs. Finally, we provide guidelines for researchers to choose among alternative estimators and an R script to facilitate the application and interpretation of AKDE home range estimates.},

	abstract = {Estimating the home ranges of animals from telemetry data can provide vital information on their spatial behaviour, which can be applied by managers to a wide range of situations including reserve design, habitat management and interactions between native and non-native species. Methods used to estimate home ranges of animals in spatially restricted environments (e.g. rivers) are liable to overestimate areas and underestimate travel distances by including unusable habitat (e.g. river bank). Currently, few studies that collect telemetry data from species in restricted environments maximise the information that can be gathered by using the most appropriate home-range estimation techniques. Simulated location datasets as well as radio-fix data from 23 northern pike (Esox lucius) were used to examine the efficiency of home-range and travel estimators, with and without correction for unusable habitat, for detecting seasonal changes in movements. Cluster analysis most clearly demonstrated changes in range area between seasons for empirical data, also showing changes in patchiness, and was least affected by unusable-environment error. Kernel analysis showed seasonal variation in range area more clearly than peripheral polygons or ellipses. Range span, a linear estimator of home range, had no significant seasonal variation. Results from all range area estimators were smallest in autumn, when cores were least fragmented and interlocation movements smallest. Cluster analysis showed that core ranges were largest and most fragmented in summer, when interlocation distances were most variable, whereas excursion-sensitive methods (e.g. kernels) recorded the largest outlines in spring, when interlocation distances were largest. Our results provide a rationale for a priori selection of home-range estimators in restricted environments. Contours containing 95\% of the location density defined by kernel analyses better reflected excursive activity than ellipses or peripheral polygons, whereas cluster analyses better defined range cores in usable habitat and indicate range fragmentation.},

	abstract = {Standard techniques for estimating size of home range for semiaquatic mammals usually result in overestimating area because unused tracts of land and water are incorporated into calculations. For River Otters (Lutra canadensis) that inhabited a narrow strip of habitat along the terrestrial-marine interface, linear length of shoreline previously was used as a measure of home-range size. Although that method produced a conservative estimate, selection of data points using that procedure did not provide any measure of probability or indication of core areas. We used the adaptive-kernel estimator and Geographic Information System (GIS) for calculating linear length of home ranges for River Otters inhabiting a marine environment and assessed the effect of reducing the bandwidth size on those home-range estimates. Using locations collected from four otters in Ester Passage, Prince William Sound, Alaska, USA, during summer 1991, we determined that adaptive kernel with 100\% and 95\% density contours resulted in a larger estimate than that produced by the previously used method. Decreasing bandwidth did not significantly alter the estimated linear distances of home range. In addition, the use of density contours of 65\% delineated core areas; therefore, this technique provided a tool with which researches can to test hypotheses such as seasonal shifts in size and location of home ranges in relation to resource availability and distribution. Our technique may be useful for estimating home ranges of other animals approximating a linear distribution of locations.},
